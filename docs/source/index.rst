typin's documentation
======================================

``typin`` is a *Type Inferencer* for understanding what types of objects
are flowing through your Python code. It observes your code dynamically and can
record all the types that each function sees, returns or raises.
``typin`` can then use this information to create Python's type annotations or
``__doc__`` strings to insert into your code.
